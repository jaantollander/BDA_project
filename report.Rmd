# The dataset
The dataset consists of *video games sales data* as of December 2016 scraped from Metacritic by @video_games_sales. In the dataset, each row represents data for a single game. The relevant fields for each row in the dataset are

* `Platform`: The abbreviation of the platform for playing the game.
* `Year_of_Release`: The year that the game was released. It contains games released between the years 1985 and 2016.
* `Global_Sales`: The number of game sales in millions.
* `Critic_Score`: A score given by critics. A number between 0 and 100.
* `User_Score`: A score given by users. A number between 0 and 10.

In this analysis, we are interested in games released between the years 2000 - 2015. Also, we focused on the most popular platform in our analysis and filtered the less popular ones.
